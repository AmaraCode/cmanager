This is a small project I worked on for 2 days to allow me to input basic company information
and keep up with conversations I was having with their employees.  I'm a developer and I seek 
project from other companies so I needed something quick beside pen and paper or Excel to help 
me keep track.  There is much to be added to this project but I though I'd share it with everyone.

It is open source so do with it what you want.  I'll continue to make updates to it.

The project does not use a database but currently saves two dictionaries to serialized JSON files.
I did this on purpose for simple projects that didn't need the overhead of a database.  

Have fun with it!
